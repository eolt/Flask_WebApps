# LeetCode Problems Generator

## Brief Description 

This program will use python request and Selenium to scrape and get problems and solutions from LeetCode.

Currently this program can request api from LeetCode, store the problems lists depending on difficulty, and run Selenium to obtain the descriptions of each problem.

## TODOs
- I plan to use a mailing api to send a random problem to someone by email at a daily or custom schedule.
- The question will be properly formatted and designed for readability and responsiveness. 
- Will implment Flask framwork to create forms to recieve user emails and create a login where users and customize type of problems and delivery schedule.
