# 5 Random Questions Game


## Intro
This quiz program uses the Flask framework to create a web browser game asking a user a series of random questions. The questions are generated from a [JSON database found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/theriley106/hq-trivia-question-database). The questions range from any topic in either history, science, or pop culture. And question are prepared in mulitple choice. The user will solve atleast 5 and receieve a percentage correct answers at the end. The user can then decide to play again and receive a new set of random questions.

## Implementation
The program implements several attributes to handle back-end and front-end aspects such as: routes, post requests, and HTML/CSS rendering. The Flask flashing system alerts the user if an answer is correct or incorrect. Bootstrap is incorporated to help with the design features of the web pages. And a built-in Python package is imported to handle the JSON database.
